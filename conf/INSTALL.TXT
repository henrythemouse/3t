********************************************************
In general these installation instructions are focused toward the 
minimum needed to get 3t running. Other configurations are 
possible and sometimes desirable depending on your server
configuration and administrative access and skills.

Windows users will have to modify the path values at least.
Use the files under the 'conf' directory for examples.
********************************************************

- STEP ONE - PACKAGE INSTALLATION

** Unpack the 3t archive in your apache document root
    You are reading this. Seems like you've already done this step.
** Install Apache (tested using ver 2.2.11)
** Install MySQL server and command client (tested using ver 5.1)
    Setup default user to be 'root' with no password
    Use 'localhost' as server, and any valid email address as a contact.
** Install Python (tested using ver 2.5.2)
** Install Python mod_python (tested using ver 3.3.1) (for Python 2.5)
    Apache can not be running during this installation.
** Install Python MySQL-python (tested using ver 1.2.2) (for Python 2.5)

- STEP TWO - PACKAGE CONFIGURATION
    ( for example, using a db named 'auto')
    
** auto:
    Rename the program dir to 'auto'.
    Create a config file: conf/config-auto.txt
    Change the paths in conf/config-auto.txt.

** Apache:
    Edit the Apache configuration file.
    Set the documentroot to the path where you want to serve the files from.
	Use the Apache Include directive to include the the 3t apache configuration file:
	Include /www/auto/conf/apache-3t.txt (refer to apache-example.txt)
	(useing your path-to-conf-file, above is just and example)
	
** MySQL:
    Create MySQL DB, using default user 'root' that has a blank password.
	Open a command prompt and cd to /www/auto/conf (example location)
	Setting up the mysql database can be done by creating an empty 
	database, importing the table layout and granting the proper permissions.
	An initial default record will be created automatically.
	(Of course you can create your own db, with any compatible structure and
	use a config-dbname.txt file to provide the needed information to the script.)
    
    Here is an example of that procedure (using the example sql.txt provided):
    
    (The mysql command line utility may not be in the executable path. In that
    case you should use the full path to the executable instead of 'mysql'.)
    
    The mysql user/password in the GRANT statement must be the same as the dbname (auto).

	# mysql -uroot
	> CREATE DATABASE auto character set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci;
	> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON auto.* TO auto@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'auto';
	> quit

	# mysql -uroot auto < sql.txt 
    
    There's a gui client provided by MySQL, if you prefer, you can use that to do the same thing.
	
** Access to the auto web page:
    Open your web browser and type the auto url in the address bar.
    
    http://localhost/auto
    
    ( for remote access you may need to use the ip address of the server in place of 'localhost')
