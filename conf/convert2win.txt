These are the steps I take to make a windowized version of fleet.

Make a copy of the fleet directory, name it "fleet10". Replace the "10" 
with the correct version number. Change to this directory.

ZIP will create the zip file and convert eol to windows type.
I use two seperate commands, one to do the text files, and one to add the binary files.
Make sure that you cover all the image extensions that will be found by zip.

1) Avoid the binary img files so the eol conversion will work.
    zip -rl fleetwin10.zip fleet10 -x \*.jpg \*.png \*.gif \*.ico \*.img
 
2) Add the image files.
    zip -ru fleetwin10.zip fleet10
    
Move the new zip file to the public ftp directory.
