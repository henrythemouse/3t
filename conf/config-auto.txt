# configuration file for all 3 table dbs (3t)
# Use this form to edit the configuration, editing this file by hand requires strict adherence to specific formatting.
#
# This file (config-(dbname).txt) must exists and must be located in the conf subdirectory of the program directory.
# This form will create the file if it is found to be missing or is a new configuration.
# To complete a new configuration you will need catImages in place under the dir "catImages/(dbname)"
# The dir is automatically created and a default img is provided.
#
# In order to use the convert2jpg feature you will need to install the Imagemagick convert utility and any
# required support files in the 3t/convert directory. This location is hardcoded because I found that at least
# some windows installations already have a convert.exe file (filesystem conversion). Ghostscript will also need to
# be installed on your system.
