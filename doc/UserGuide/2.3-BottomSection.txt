Default View Bottom

At the very bottom of the program window is the toolbar. A status message is printed on the left end. A contact link (configurable) is located at the center of the toolbar. At the far right is a login/logout link. You can login using a mysql user account.

The status message area will show you how many rows the result table contains.

The contact link will open an email client in accordance with your system configuration.

The login/logout link will display the name of the person who is logged in and will provide a login link when no one is logged in.
