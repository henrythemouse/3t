Python

You don't need to know anything about python to use 3T, but you will need to have python and related software installed.

Install:

python v2.x (v3.Ã— is on the todo list)
modpython (apache module)
mysqlpython (python to MySql glue)

3T is a python script. The primary file is index.py.All functions branch from this file based on user interaction. Modpython is used to retrieve the url from Apache. The url is parsed for name/value pairs which in turn are used to direct program execution.

The html page that the user sees is main.html. It is a template located in the templates directory. Modpython is used here to insert program variables that contain data to be displayed and to insert python code inside the html. This python code is used to branch the html based on user interaction.

Much of the html code is assembled in the various python files and then passed to main.html. This code is not written out line by line but rather generated by a python module whose function is solely to generate html. This module was originally published under the name HTMLgen. It has been extensively modified for use with 3T. The original module will not provide the needed functionality and so the modified module and some of it's required extensions are included with 3T.

PythonMysql is used to submit the MySql queries to the MySql server. 3T has been tested using myiasm and innodb table types only. Persistent MySQL connections are not used. Eveytime a query is submitted a connection is opened, the query is run and the connection is closed.
