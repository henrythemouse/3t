_category

The_category table has these columns:

_id The primary column
category The category name
image The category image

Refer to the requiredTables.sql file for the detailed table definition.

Every DB will have it's own _category table. The images stored in this table are written to disk when 3T is first loaded and after the table has been modified. Their location is:

serverroot/3t/catimages/dbname/

Where server root is the directory that apache is configured to serve web pages from.

Where dbname is the name of the  MySql DB that the images are from.

3T will load these images from disk when started and after the table has been modified.

The category names will comprise the category selection list.

The category names are used to compose select sql queries. These queries limit the search results to records that contain the selected name in the catTable's category column.

Modifying the data in this table will not modify any data in any other table of any other MySql DB.



Refer to the User Manual for a description of how the data in this table is used by the UI.
