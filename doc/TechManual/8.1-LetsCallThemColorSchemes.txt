T- Themes

At this point themes are nothing more than css color schemes. Any file in the style directory that ends with .css and is not named base.css will be selectable as a theme in the configuration dialog.

If you want to create a new theme copy the contents of the default theme (default.css) to a new .css file under the style directory. Then change the background and foreground colors as you like. Of course backgrounds can also be images.

If you want to go deeper you can edit the base.css file which contains mostly the position and sizes of the various divisions. Save a copy of this file to a file named default.orig in the same directory, just in case you want to go back to it.

In addition there are copies of base.css and default.css in this document.
