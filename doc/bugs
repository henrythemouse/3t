In kooky2.py I added a line when no action is called out, to return the cookie.
This allows me to start the program up (using the read db).
But it stops me from saving a note record (books save ok though). This might be related to 
the media table save is called verses how the initial cookie is saved?

Also, the author names seem to be firstnam/lastname at startup (?) and then lastname/firstame later.
